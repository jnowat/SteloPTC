      # Build MSI only (skip NSIS).  NSIS downloads nsis_tauri_utils.dll
      # from GitHub Releases, which regularly 502s and breaks CI.
      # The MSI is the standard Windows installer — NSIS is redundant.
      # beforeBuildCommand in tauri.conf.json runs `npm run build` (Vite)
      # automatically, so no separate frontend build step is needed.
      # Retry up to 3 times for transient network errors (WiX download).
